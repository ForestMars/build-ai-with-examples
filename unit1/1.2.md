Pipeline Parallelism: Forward/Backward Passes Across Layers

Part 2 of "Distributed Training from Scratch"

In the last post, we carved up attention heads like a distributed sushi chef in a Murakami story, splitting individual operations across GPUs, praying our gradients would synchronize properly, and like a Murakami protagonist, hoping their disparate worlds would somehow align in the end. Today, we're going vertical. Instead of splitting computations within layers, we're going to split the layers themselves across devices, creating a computational assembly line that would make Henry Ford weep with joy. At at least his digital twin. 

Welcome to pipeline parallelism, where your x billion parameter transformer becomes a factory floor with each GPU responsible for a different stage of production. GPU 0 handles layers 1-8, GPU 1 takes layers 9-16, and so on. Simple, elegant, and absolutely riddled with the kind of subtle timing dependencies that will have you debugging phantom deadlocks at 3 AM while questioning your life choices. (I promise I’ll stop saying that, but I’m literally speaking from experience.) 

The beautiful irony is that pipeline parallelism is simultaneously the most intuitive form of model parallelism (obviously you put different layers on different devices!) and the most diabolically complex to get right. It's like explaining how a car engine works versus actually building one that doesn't explode on the first try. (That joke will probably be lost on the next generation, since motors generally don’t explode.) 

The Assembly Line: Layers as Pipeline Stages

The core insight behind pipeline parallelism is deceptively simple. Your transformer has, say, 80 layers. You have 8 GPUs. Put 10 layers on each GPU, and boom, you've got yourself a pipeline. Data flows from GPU 0 through GPU 7, each device applying its layers in sequence.

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from typing import List, Optional

class PipelineStage(nn.Module):
    """A single stage in our pipeline (multiple transformer layers)"""
    
    def __init__(self, layers: List[nn.Module], stage_id: int):
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList(layers)
        self.stage_id = stage_id
        
    def forward(self, x):
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = layer(x)
        return x

class NaivePipelineParallelTransformer(nn.Module):
    """The simplest possible pipeline parallel transformer"""
    
    def __init__(self, total_layers=80, num_stages=8, d_model=512):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_stages = num_stages
        self.layers_per_stage = total_layers // num_stages
        
        # Create all transformer layers
        all_layers = [TransformerLayer(d_model) for _ in range(total_layers)]
        
        # Split layers across stages
        self.stages = nn.ModuleList([
            PipelineStage(
                all_layers[i * self.layers_per_stage:(i + 1) * self.layers_per_stage],
                stage_id=i
            ) for i in range(num_stages)
        ])
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Sequential execution (this is wrong, but let's start here)
        for stage in self.stages:
            x = stage(x)
        return x


This naive implementation misses the entire point. We're still running everything sequentially on a single device. The magic happens when we actually distribute these stages across GPUs and start overlapping computation.

The Bubble Problem: Why Pipeline Parallelism is Hard

Here's where pipeline parallelism gets interesting in all the wrong ways. Unlike data parallelism (where all GPUs work independently) or tensor parallelism (where GPUs collaborate on the same computation), pipeline parallelism creates dependencies. GPU 1 can't start working until GPU 0 finishes. GPU 2 waits for GPU 1. And so on.

This creates what we lovingly call "pipeline bubbles" - periods where GPUs sit idle waiting for data from upstream stages. In the worst case, only one GPU is working at a time, giving you 1/8th the performance of a single device. Not exactly the scaling we were hoping for.

The solution is micro-batching: instead of sending one large batch through the pipeline, we split it into smaller micro-batches that can overlap in different stages.

class MicroBatch:
    """A single micro-batch flowing through the pipeline"""
    
    def __init__(self, data: torch.Tensor, micro_batch_id: int):
        self.data = data
        self.micro_batch_id = micro_batch_id
        self.stage_outputs = {}  # Cache outputs at each stage
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"MicroBatch(id={self.micro_batch_id}, shape={self.data.shape})"

class PipelineScheduler:
    """Manages the flow of micro-batches through pipeline stages"""
    
    def __init__(self, num_stages: int, num_micro_batches: int):
        self.num_stages = num_stages
        self.num_micro_batches = num_micro_batches
        
        # Each stage maintains a queue of micro-batches
        self.stage_queues = [[] for _ in range(num_stages)]
        self.completed_forward = []
        self.completed_backward = []
        
    def create_schedule(self):
        """Generate the optimal schedule for forward/backward passes"""
        schedule = []
        
        # Forward passes: stagger micro-batches across stages
        for step in range(self.num_stages + self.num_micro_batches - 1):
            for stage_id in range(self.num_stages):
                micro_batch_id = step - stage_id
                if 0 <= micro_batch_id < self.num_micro_batches:
                    schedule.append(('forward', stage_id, micro_batch_id))
        
        # Backward passes: reverse order
        for step in range(self.num_stages + self.num_micro_batches - 1):
            for stage_id in range(self.num_stages - 1, -1, -1):
                micro_batch_id = step - (self.num_stages - 1 - stage_id)
                if 0 <= micro_batch_id < self.num_micro_batches:
                    schedule.append(('backward', stage_id, micro_batch_id))
                    
        return schedule


GPipe vs PipeDream: The Scheduling Wars

There are two main approaches to pipeline scheduling, and choosing between them is like choosing between different types of controlled chaos.

GPipe (Google's approach): Complete all forward passes before starting backward passes. Simple, synchronous, but creates large pipeline bubbles. Think of it as a batch processing system.

PipeDream (Microsoft's approach): Interleave forward and backward passes to minimize bubbles. More complex, but much better hardware utilization. Think of it as a streaming system.

Here's a simplified PipeDream implementation:

Memory Management: The Hidden Complexity

Pipeline parallelism creates a subtle but critical memory management problem. During forward passes, you need to store activations for the backward pass. But with micro-batching, you might have multiple forward passes in flight before the first backward pass starts.

This means your memory usage grows linearly with the number of micro-batches. Too few micro-batches and you get pipeline bubbles. Too many and you run out of memory. Welcome to the optimization nightmare.

The Communication Pattern: Point-to-Point Chaos

Unlike the all-reduce patterns in data and tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism uses point-to-point communication. GPU 0 only talks to GPU 1, GPU 1 talks to GPU 0 and GPU 2, and so on. This creates a beautiful linear communication pattern that scales perfectly... until it doesn't.

The problem is that point-to-point communication is much harder to optimize than collective operations. NCCL is heavily optimized for all-reduce, but peer-to-peer transfers can become bottlenecks, especially with high-bandwidth interconnects where the latency matters more than bandwidth.

Load Balancing: When Layers Aren't Created Equal

Here's a dirty secret about transformer layers: they're not all the same computational cost. Early layers often do more heavy lifting, attention patterns vary with depth, and some layers might have more parameters than others. If you naively split 80 layers into 8 groups of 10, you might end up with massive load imbalancing.

The Performance Reality Check

Pipeline parallelism is a double-edged sword. When it works well, you get excellent memory efficiency and can train models that would never fit on a single device. When it works poorly, you get pipeline bubbles that make your expensive GPU cluster perform worse than a single machine.

The efficiency formula is roughly:

Pipeline Efficiency = (num_micro_batches) / (num_micro_batches + num_stages - 1)


With 8 stages and 16 micro-batches, you get about 70% efficiency. Not terrible, but not great either. The key is finding the sweet spot between memory usage and pipeline bubbles.

The Memory vs Bubble Time Trade-off

Here's the fundamental tension in pipeline parallelism: more micro-batches means better pipeline utilization but higher memory usage. Fewer micro-batches means lower memory usage but worse utilization. There's no free lunch.

def calculate_pipeline_efficiency(num_stages: int, num_micro_batches: int) -> dict:
    """Calculate various pipeline efficiency metrics"""
    
    # Theoretical efficiency (ignoring communication)
    theoretical_efficiency = num_micro_batches / (num_micro_batches + num_stages - 1)
    
    # Memory scaling (linear with micro-batches)
    memory_multiplier = num_micro_batches
    
    # Bubble time (time when not all stages are active)
    bubble_steps = num_stages - 1
    total_steps = num_micro_batches + num_stages - 1
    bubble_percentage = (bubble_steps / total_steps) * 100
    
    return {
        'efficiency': theoretical_efficiency,
        'memory_multiplier': memory_multiplier,
        'bubble_percentage': bubble_percentage,
        'throughput_ratio': theoretical_efficiency,
    }

# Find optimal micro-batch count
for num_micro_batches in [4, 8, 16, 32]:
    metrics = calculate_pipeline_efficiency(8, num_micro_batches)
    print(f"Micro-batches: {num_micro_batches}")
    print(f"  Efficiency: {metrics['efficiency']:.1%}")
    print(f"  Memory: {metrics['memory_multiplier']}x")
    print(f"  Bubble time: {metrics['bubble_percentage']:.1f}%")
    print()


What's Next: The Hybrid Future

Pure pipeline parallelism is rarely the answer for modern large models. The real magic happens when you combine it with tensor parallelism and data parallelism in clever ways. Imagine splitting your model both horizontally (tensor parallelism within layers) and vertically (pipeline parallelism across layers), then replicating the whole thing across multiple data parallel groups. This is essentially data layout coherence for AI models, viz. maintaining alignment between your data organization and access patterns across the entire stack, from storage through compute kernels. The key insight is designing sharding strategies where horizontal and vertical data flows naturally align, creating end-to-end data locality optimization that maximizes bandwidth utilization efficiency at every level of the compute hierarchy.

But that's a story for the next post, where we'll dive into 3D parallelism and learn how to orchestrate tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism simultaneously without losing our sanity.

For now, you have the tools to build production-ready pipeline parallel training. The code above will actually run and give you meaningful performance insights. Just don't blame me when you're debugging communication deadlocks at 3 AM while your GPUs burn electricity doing nothing. I’ll be busy stacking NVDA. 

The universal Turing machine processed one symbol at a time on an infinite tape. We've decided that's too slow, so we've built an assembly line of Turing machines, each processing different parts of the computation in parallel. Progress, or madness? It’s a real question. And honestly at this point, who is left to disagree that it’s probably both?

Next up: Data Parallelism and Gradient Synchronization - Where we learn to love AllReduce and hate communication bottlenecks.
